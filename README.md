# mbpackage

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mbpackage is to make some calculations

## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maellebeaudinet/mbpackage")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(mbpackage)
## basic example code
```

``` r
somme(2,8)
#> [1] 10
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
