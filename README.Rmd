<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"

```

# mbpackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mbpackage is to make some calculations

## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maellebeaudinet/mbpackage")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mbpackage)
## basic example code
```


```{r cars}
somme(2,8)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
